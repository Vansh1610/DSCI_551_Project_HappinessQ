# Emulated File Distribution System with World Data Analysis

App Link - https://happinessq.onrender.com/

This repository contains an Emulated File Distribution System that is designed to store file data along with associated metadata, and perform analysis on world happiness, unemployment, and GDP data using two different database systems: SQL and Firebase. The system also includes command-line tools for managing the data, as well as a partition-based MapReduce implementation for searching and analyzing the stored data. The analysis results are visualized using a web application built with Flask.

## Introduction

The Emulated File Distribution System is a project that demonstrates the storage, management, and analysis of file data and metadata, combined with real-world data related to world happiness, unemployment, and GDP. The system uses both SQL and Firebase as database backends to provide flexibility and showcase different database technologies.

## Features

- Store and manage file data and metadata in SQL and Firebase databases.
- Command-line tools (`put`, `rm`, `getPartitionLocation`, `readPartition`, etc.) implemented in Python and Javascript for interacting with the system.
- Partition-based MapReduce for searching and analyzing stored data efficiently.
- Flask-based web application for visualizing analysis results.
